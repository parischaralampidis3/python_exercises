MODULE, CLASSES, AND OBJECTS.
-----------------------------

Python is something called an object oriented programming language. What this means is there's a construct in Python called a class that let's you stucture your software in particular way.
Using classes you can add consistency to your programs so that they can be used in a cleaner way.
A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
Class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and userd by creating an instance of that class.

Some points on Python class:

- Classes are created by keyword class

- Attributes are the variables that belong to a class

- Attibutes are always public and can be accessed using the dot(.) operator.
